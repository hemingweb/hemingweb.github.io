I spent the morning researching test-driven development (TDD), I am writing a short piece for a course. I came across the following from Kent Beck and found it thought-provoking:

> Lean Production identifies two kinds of waste. The first kind of waste is pure waste--you screwed up and you knew better, or you are sitting around waiting because of poor resource allocation.

> The second kind of waste is waste that is necessary at the moment, but doesn’t really add value. Inspections are a perfect example--your process creates too many defects to just ship units to customers, but you’d really rather eliminate the defects at the source, at which point you can eliminate the inspections without removing value.

> The tests we write in TDD, then, are Type II waste--necessary at the moment but not a direct addition of value. We need the tests to write clean code that works, but the customer isn’t paying for the tests, but the code. If we could figure out how to eliminate the tests and still have clean code that works, we could improve productivity substantially. How might it be possible to move from Test-Driven Development to just Driven Development?
