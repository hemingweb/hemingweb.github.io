##work

I worked from home today and took the oportunity to get an early start, so
was at my desk for 7am. An API we interact with is depicating some call, so I've
been updating our code. In doing so, it has reveiled some issues. I have been able to collect some data over the last few days and today was the ideal oportunity to fix the issues.

##study

I started reading [Show your work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) and
descided to build this blog to support some personal objectives.
