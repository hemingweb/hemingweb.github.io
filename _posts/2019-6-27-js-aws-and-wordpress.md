I've felt tired over the last few days, hence not posting. So, here's a quick update.

I've been investigating some of Vue.js's features, looking into its routing capabilities for multiple domains.

I reviewed AWS to see if there were any potential cost savings I could make. I identified several, based around reducing EC2 disk size and migrating to newer T3 instances. However, on looking into it, it really needs to be a planned project. So it will have to wait.

Looking to leverage location data from Google, to increase conversion rates. I updated some of the WordPress templates to pull the data. The tests haven't started yet but there's no reason to think it'll have a detrimental effect.
