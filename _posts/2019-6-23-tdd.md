title: Test-driven development - part 2
tags: study
---

I finished the first draft of my TDD piece. Unfortunately, I can't share it as it is part of a uni assignment.

The material I found in the literature search was really interesting. I think the TDD intentions are very good, but it seems there are implementation difficulties.

As a developer I want to get the job done and delivered, I enjoy solving problems. Therefore, the green phase is where the fun is. However, this is arguably the least important phase of TDD. Understanding the requirements is needed to write the tests, show me a developer that isn't thinking how they can deliver the feature while they are reading a requirements document. The TDD process is already broken at this point.

I haven't worked in a TDD environment, I am aware this affects my view. TDD seems to be a way of thinking rather than a way of doing, and getting a team of developers to change and align their thinking must be harder than changing a process, and that's no easy task.
