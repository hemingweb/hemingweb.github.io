It feels as though I have had an unproductive day, due to working on several things in fragmented sessions

I have had an issue with a node function that scans dynamoDB. The query runs in AWS CLI, but not in a lambda function with the same parameters. I initially spent a bit of time looking into the issue but got nowhere with it, and had to move onto other tasks. I've recently engaged with AWS a lot and someone made contact regard RDS solutions. It gave me the opportunity to detail the NoSQL issue to see if I can get some assistance. I don't have high hopes but some new ideas would be a good start.

I had several planning sessions on a new feature that's been in the pipeline for a month or so. Obviously, the spec has evolved within the business and depending on the priorities I might have to go back to the drawing board.

I have started planning the main part of my uni assignment. It's not a huge amount of work as I'm tired, but I have read through what is required and planned the tasks as well as contacting my tutor with a few questions, overall, some progress.
