As a developer and manager, it has come to my attention that I am not very good at
shouting about what I do. Whilst, I do not have a particular problem with this, I
feel it affects the perception of my team within the business. And that can be a
problem.

I am sure there are a bunch of very good reasons for this, but in an attempt to
improve this skill, I've decided to blog about what I am doing. The motivation
for this particular action came from [Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/)
and his recommendation of [Show your work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/).



If you have not seen [Ali Abdaal's](https://aliabdaal.com/)
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64/featured),
it is a great source of learning and productivity tips. I consider myself to be
a life learner. As such, maybe I can start shouting about what I am doing and
subsequently represent my team better.
