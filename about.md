As a developer and manager, it has come to my attention that I am not very good at shouting about what I do. I am sure there are a bunch of very good reasons for this, but in an attempt to improve my skills, I've decided to blog about what I am doing. The motivation for this came from [Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/) and his recommendation of [Show your work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/).


If you have not seen [Ali Abdaal's](https://aliabdaal.com/) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Sepharoth64/featured), it is a great source of learning and productivity tips. I consider myself to be a life learner. As such, maybe I can start shouting about what I am doing.
